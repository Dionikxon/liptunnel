## 🤖 What is liptunnel?

liptunnel is a lightweight tool that lets you create secure tunnels for your web applications. You can use it to expose services running on your VPS with your own domain. With liptunnel, you gain a fast and unlimited alternative to Ngrok that is easy to set up and manage. It is developer-friendly, making it the perfect choice for users who want full control.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Before running liptunnel, ensure that you have a VPS ready and a domain set up. These are essential for creating secure tunnels. 

1. **VPS Setup**: You can use any cloud provider for your VPS (e.g., DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.). A minimal server configuration will work well.
2. **Domain Configuration**: Make sure your domain's DNS settings point to your VPS.
